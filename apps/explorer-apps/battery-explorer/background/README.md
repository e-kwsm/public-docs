### Search&#x20;

The Battery Explorer app, just like the Materials Explorer app, provides a search bar where one can search by chemical formula (eg. "CoO2") or by chemical system (eg. "Fe-P-O"). The user can also click on the periodic table to add elements to the search.

### Advanced Options

On the left tab on the app, users can choose to filter query results by composition and working ion,  as well as battery properties such as average voltage or capacity.
